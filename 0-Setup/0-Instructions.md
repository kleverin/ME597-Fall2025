# ME 597- Lab 0

## Introduction

### Welcome to ME597: Autonomous Systems

Throughout the course of the semester there are weekly labs. These labs will develop your skills in the programming and control of autonomous systems. Labs will be completed in the Gazebo simulation environment and the TurtleBot4 when specified. We have selected and created material that will complement the topics explained during lectures. The Lab activities will be posted according to the schedule published on the course site. Questions will be answered by TA’s through the mechanisms specified in the syllabus. In case a tool related issue is observed, please take a screenshot of the error, and provide a brief description of the steps to reproduce the problem, this will help us to debug the problem and promptly find a solution to it. 

# Computer Use and Software Access
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and ROS2 Humble will be used throughout this course. If you use a Windows computer, you may use VMWare, a virtual machine software, to virtualize Ubuntu OS. It is optional to install Ubuntu and ROS2 manually onto your computers (e.g., via dual-boot) to improve the performance. We highly recommend you install Ubuntu and ROS2 on your personal machine as the lab is not available outside the hours of 11:30 - 14:15 on Wednesday and Friday. If you do not have a reliable computer, there are Linux based computers available for use during the lab that have ROS2 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS already installed for your use.


### Lab Scope
It is important to note that the lectures will focus primarily on the theoretical aspects of mobile robotics. Programming and practical implementation skills, specifically in ROS2, will not be covered in the lectures. Instead, you are expected to develop these skills independently in the lab sessions. We have provided resources and materials to guide your learning process in the lab, where you can apply some of the theoretical knowledge gained from the lectures. It is assumed that students will come in with Python experience. Ubuntu or other Linux experience is beneficial but optional. ROS or ROS2 experience is not required.

### General Instructions
1. Lab activities will be posted on the dates specified in the Syllabus.
2. A basic Python level is expected from the students.
3. Questions will be answered through Piazza and during lab: The lab session should be used as office hours to make best use of your limited lab time and in-person TA help. It is highly recommended to start working on the labs before the lab sessions.
4. Discussion between students is allowed, however, the deliverables must show the effort of the individual. When a team deliverable is required, it will be specified in the lab sheet. 
5. All individuals must submit work for all tasks, including any partnered tasks.

### Assignment
1. Signup to Piazza using the following link: [ME597 Fall 2025](https://piazza.com/purdue/fall2025/me597as). 
2. Verify that you can complete a test upload into Gradescope. We will create a test assignment in which you will have to load a simple text file compressed in *.zip format.
3. Answer the pre-course survey available on Brightspace. The pre-course survey is only graded for completion.
4. Complete the [OS installation guide](1-OS_installation_guide.md)
5. Complete the [ROS 2 installation guide](2-ROS_2_installation_guide.md)

### Deliverables
1. Complete the Pre-course survey on Brightspace--Course tools--Surveys.
2. Visible login activity in your accounts. This is a non-graded activity, however, it is important for us to see if you experience troubles while accessing Gradescope, Piazza or setting up Ubuntu and ROS 2.
